# About me


My name is Madison Schmitt and I am a sophomore at Lehigh University, studying Journalism and Marketing. I'm originally from Long Valley, New Jersey where I grew up with two older brothers and a yellow lab. I love being active with a specific passion for playing soccer and lacrosse.

# Philadelphia Eagles' Road to Super Bowl LII
The Eagles have been underdogs from the start of the season, and when their starting quarterback endured an injury halfway through the season, their dreams of finally winning a Super Bowl seemed almost impossible. To all of our surprise, and to my extreme happiness, they made it! Below is an infographic I made to depict their monstrous victory over the Minnesota Vikings.

# A Timeline of Miley Cyrus' Mental Breakdown
Itâ€™s probably impossible to be a 13-year-old pop star with a TV show without being just a little bit crazy. Miley had her father, Billy Ray, push her into show business, and soon she was sucked into the Disney Channel machine. What started as America's favorite country sweetheart turned into something drastically shocking, almost disgusting. Here's a timeline to break it all down.

# Tiger Woods vs. Phil Mickelson Earnings 2008-2017

The Masters, the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship are just a few of the major golf events that I grew up watching every year. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are two athletes that have always stood out to me--their commitment to and passion for the sport has lead them to achieve countless victories on the most difficult courses in the world. And with victories, of course, comes massive amounts of prize money. The following line graph illustrates the total yearly earnings of Woods and Mickelson from the past 10 years. It's especially interesting to note that Mickelson has maintained consistency while Woods has seen extreme highs and extreme lows--potentially due to injuries and personal conflict.
