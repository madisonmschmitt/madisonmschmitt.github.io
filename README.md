# About me


My name is Madison Schmitt and I am a sophomore at Lehigh University, studying Journalism and Marketing. I'm originally from Long Valley, New Jersey where I grew up with two older brothers and a yellow lab. I love being active with a specific passion for playing soccer and lacrosse.

# Philadelphia Eagles' Road to Super Bowl LII
The Eagles have been underdogs from the start of the season, and when their starting quarterback endured an injury halfway through the season, their dreams of finally winning a Super Bowl seemed almost impossible. To all of our surprise, and to my extreme happiness, they made it! Below is an infographic I made to depict their monstrous victory over the Minnesota Vikings.
